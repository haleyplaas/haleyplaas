- Hi there, I’m @haleyplaas! a PhD Candidate at UNC-Chapel Hill. I study aerosol emissions from harmful cyanobacterial blooms to inform public health risks. 

- I’m interested in careers at the intersection of environmental quality and public health. I'm using GitHub to share my research with stakeholders in the state of North Carolina and the science community beyond.

- I’m currently learning data cleaning, data visualization, and regression modeling in R! 

- You can reach me at hplaas@live.unc.edu
