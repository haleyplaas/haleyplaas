- Hi there, I’m @haleyplaas! a PhD student at UNC-Chapel Hill. I study the impact that harmful cyanobacterial blooms have on air quality and respiratory health through the aerosolization of aquatic toxins and cells into the air, as well as the potential formation of secondary aerosols from gases emitted by cyanobacterial blooms. 

- I’m interested in the intersection of environmental quality and public health. I'm using GitHub to share my research with stakeholders in the state of North Carolina and the science community beyond.

- I’m currently learning data cleaning, data visualization, and generalized additive modeling in R! 

- You can reach me at hplaas@live.unc.edu
